# Tiny Mode Settings

When in Tiny Mode, a number of settings become available in Unity's main [settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html) window.

These settings give you control over how your project is organized and how it should be built when you create a build.

There are six sections to the Tiny Mode settings in the inspector:

- [The main Project settings](settings-main.md)
- [The Assembly Definition settings](settings-asmdef.md)
