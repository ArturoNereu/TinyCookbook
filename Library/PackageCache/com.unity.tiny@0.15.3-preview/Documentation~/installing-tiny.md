# Installing the package

## Package Manager

Follow these steps:

1. From the menu, choose **Window > Package Manager** to open the package manager.
2. In the package manager, check the **Advanced** dropdown and make sure **Show Preview Packages** is enabled.
3. From the package list in the left-hand pane, choose **Tiny Mode**.
4. In the right-hand pane, click the **Install** button.

> We recommend to avoid using Tiny Mode with other *preview* packages.

## Prerequisites

Tiny Mode works when installed in a new Unity 2019.2.0b1 (or above) project. If you install it in an existing project, you may have to manually change some project settings to ensure compatibility.

The minimum requirements for Scripting in Tiny Mode are [Visual Studio 2017 15.8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2017-version-15-8/) or [JetBrains Rider 2019.1](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2019/04/30/rider-2019-1-arrived/).
