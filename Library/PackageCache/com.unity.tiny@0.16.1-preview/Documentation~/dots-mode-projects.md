# DOTS Mode Projects

A DOTS Mode project represents a game or app which can be deployed to platforms that DOTS Mode supports.

A DOTS Mode project is represented by an Asset within a classic Unity Project. This means a single Unity Project can contain multiple DOTS Mode projects. DOTS Mode projects are represented by an asset file in the Project window. DOTS Mode projects have the .project filename suffix. 

You can get started by creating a new DOTS Mode project from the **DOTS > New Project** menu. Choose a name for your new DOTS Mode project file, and save it within your Unity Project. Unity will then automatically open the new DOTS Mode project, and switch to DOTS Mode.

Below you can see the files that are created for you by default when you create a new DOTS Mode project. The project file itself is represented by the grey file box icon, and the Assembly Definition file is represented.

When in DOTS Mode, you can only use Entities and Scenes in your Hierarchy, and your Entities can only accept DOTS Mode components.
