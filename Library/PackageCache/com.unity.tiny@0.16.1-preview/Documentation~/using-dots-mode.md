# Using Project Tiny & DOTS Mode in the Editor

With Project Tiny, weâ€™ve introduced "DOTS Mode" in the Editor. This mode transforms the Editor to working with pure DOTS data, giving you appropriate tools and context.

DOTS Mode is a special mode in the Unity Editor. Unity automatically switches to DOTS Mode when you open a DOTS Mode project, or create a new DOTS Mode project. Unity switches *out* of DOTS Mode (back to classic mode) if you open a regular Unity Scene in your project, or open a different Unity Project that does not use DOTS Mode.

Because Project Tiny is DOTS-only, we recommend you start from a blank new Unity project. For the rest of this section we are discussing about DOTS Mode in the context of Project Tiny.
