# Scripting with Project Tiny in DOTS Mode

Scripting in DOTS Mode is based on the [Entity-Component-System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest)[ ](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest)(ECS) architectural pattern.

You can author Entities in the Editor, however you must create Components and Systems using scripting.
